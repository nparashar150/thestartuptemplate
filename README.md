# Playground builder

## **Using the Playground**

1.  **Login and head to the Playground**: After logging in, you'll land on the Playground page. This is where you can customise your project.

    <figure><picture><source srcset=".gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-05-24 at 12.35.08 PM.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-05-24 at 12.36.53 PM.png" alt=""></picture><figcaption><p>Playground screenshot</p></figcaption></figure>
2. **Edit Your Settings**: Change the configuration options and see the results immediately. The Playground shows a live preview of your changes, making it easy to see how your project will look.\

3. **Autosave**: Don't worry about saving your work. The Playground automatically saves your settings as you make changes, so you won't lose any progress.\

4.  **Generate Your Project**: Once you're happy with your settings, generate your project by running this command in your terminal:\


    ```bash
    npx create-thestartuptemplate --email=john@doe.com
    ```

    \
    Replace `john@doe.com` with your email address. This will create the startup template with all your Playground settings already applied.
