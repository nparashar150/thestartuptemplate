### Step 1: Clone the Package

First, create the startup template

```bash
npx create-thestartuptemplate "yourAppNameWithoutQuotes"
cd yourAppNameWithoutQuotes
```

### Step 2: Create an Account on EdgeDB Cloud

Head over to [EdgeDB Cloud](https://www.edgedb.com/cloud) and create an account. Once you're logged in, set up a new EdgeDB instance.

### Step 3: Get EdgeDB Keys

After creating your EdgeDB instance, you will receive the `EDGEDB_INSTANCE` and `EDGEDB_SECRET_KEY`. Save these in your `.env` file:

```env
EDGEDB_INSTANCE=your_instance_id
EDGEDB_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

### Step 4: Create an Account on Mailgun

Sign up for a Mailgun account at [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/). After setting up your domain, obtain the `MAILGUN_DOMAIN`, `MAILGUN_SENDER_EMAIL`, and `MAILGUN_API_KEY`, and add them to your `.env` file:

```env
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=your_mailgun_domain
MAILGUN_SENDER_EMAIL=your_sender_email
MAILGUN_API_KEY=your_mailgun_api_key
```

### Step 5: Enable Google Login

To enable Google login, you need to create credentials on the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/):

1. Go to the Google Cloud Console.
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Navigate to the OAuth consent screen and configure it.
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials and get your `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.

Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
```

### Step 6: Enable GitHub Login

To enable GitHub login, you need to create a GitHub application at [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers):

1. Go to the GitHub Developer Settings.
2. Click on "New OAuth App".
3. Fill in the required details and register your application.
4. Obtain your `GITHUB_ID` and `GITHUB_SECRET`.

Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
GITHUB_ID=your_github_client_id
GITHUB_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
```

### Step 7: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 8: Run the Project

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see your project in action.
