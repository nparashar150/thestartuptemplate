# Connecting to EdgeDB Cloud

## **Create an EdgeDB Cloud Account**:

Go to [EdgeDB Cloud](https://www.edgedb.com/cloud) and create an account if you don't have one.

## **Set Up an EdgeDB Instance**:

Once logged in, set up a new EdgeDB instance.

## **Get Your EdgeDB Keys**:

After creating the instance, you will receive the following keys:

1. `EDGEDB_INSTANCE`
2. `EDGEDB_SECRET_KEY`

## **Update Your .env File**:

Add the keys to your `.env` file in your project directory:

```env
EDGEDB_INSTANCE=your_instance_id
EDGEDB_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

This will connect your project to the EdgeDB Cloud instance and allow you to manage your database seamlessly.
